# GetEDID
Generic windows EDID read utility which uses WinRT API's to print out EDID of all connected displays. It prints the hex values in a format easily consumable by other EDID parsing tools. This way it helps developers, vendors, OEM's, display vendors etc. to read EDID quickly for debug purposes.
